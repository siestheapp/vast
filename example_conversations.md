# Example VAST Conversations

Here are some natural conversations you can have with VAST about your movie database:

## Analytics & Reporting

**You**: "Which actors have appeared in the most films?"

**You**: "Show me the top 10 customers by total rental revenue"

**You**: "What are our most popular film categories?"

**You**: "Which films have never been rented?"

## Database Modifications

**You**: "I want to add a review system where customers can rate films they've rented"

**You**: "Let's track which employees helped each customer - add a recommendation system"

**You**: "We need to implement a loyalty program with points for each rental"

## Business Rules

**You**: "From now on, never allow deleting customer records - use soft deletes instead"

**You**: "Implement a rule that customers can't rent more than 5 films at once"

**You**: "Add an audit trail for all payment modifications"

## Data Management

**You**: "Create a new film category called 'Superhero' and add some films to it"

**You**: "Add a new customer named John Smith with email john@example.com"

**You**: "Update all films from 2006 to have a minimum rental rate of $2.99"

## Complex Features

**You**: "Design a wishlist system where customers can save films they want to watch"

**You**: "I want to track film recommendations - who recommended what to whom"

**You**: "Create a seasonal pricing system where certain categories cost more during holidays"

## Schema Evolution

**You**: "We're expanding internationally - how should we handle multiple currencies?"

**You**: "Add support for digital streaming in addition to physical rentals"

**You**: "We want to start selling films too, not just renting - design that feature"

## Remember: VAST will:
